\chapter{Searching for high mass resonances in dielectron final state}\label{chap:Zprime}
\textit{In order to address the shortcoming of the standard model (SM), there are several theories beyond the SM predicting the existence of heavy resonances at the TeV scale that can couple to quarks or gluons and can decay to dilepton pairs. Examples include a heavy Z boson-like particle, denoted $Z^{'}$, such as the $Z^{'}_{SSM}$ boson of the sequential standard model with SM-like couplings, or the $Z^{'}_{\psi}$ boson which inspired by superstring models and the spin 2 Kaluza-Klein graviton which comes from the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model with one extra dimension. This analysis uses proton-proton collision data at the centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 and 2017, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9$fb^{-1}$ and 41.4$fb^{-1}$ respectively. The strategy of the analysis is looking for a ``bump'' in the dielectron invariant mass distribution, in particular in the high mass tail.}
