\subsection{Conclusions}
In order to get the correct energy for saturated electron which has very high energy, we tried MVA method and it works well in barrel in wide energy range, for endcap there are a small bias in low erengy because of low statistics for training. Besides we also checked the ECAL linearity response in data which seems good and there are ~1\% difference between the reconstructed energy and energy from MVA. Finally we studied the effection of saturation to the HEEP ID efficiency which shows the HEEP ID still works well for saturated electron.
