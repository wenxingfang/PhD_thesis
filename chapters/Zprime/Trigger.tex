\section{Trigger}\label{sec:Zprime_trigger}
The primary high level trigger (HLT) used in the main analysis for 2016 and 2017 is HLT\_DoubleEle33\_CaloIdL\_MW which requires two electron candidates with \et of the supercluster higher than 33 GeV and passing loose calorimeter identification (CaloIdL) requirements and Medium Window (MW) matching between the gaussian sum filter (gsf) \cite{0954-3899-31-9-N01} track and the hits in pixel detector. In the run period of 276453 to 278822 of 2016 this trigger was prescaled and HLT\_DoubleEle33\_CaloIdL\_GsfTrkIdVL was used as the primary signal trigger. The HLT\_DoubleEle33\_CaloIdL\_GsfTrkIdVL is the same as HLT\_DoubleEle33\_CaloIdL\_MW except replacing MW pixel matching by very loose matching between the gsf track and the supercluster in ECAL (GsfTrkIdVL).

The level 1 trigger (L1) seeding of the primary high level trigger is always seeded by the OR of a DoubleEG (two deposit in ECAL) seed, a SingleEG (one deposit in ECAL) seed and a SingleJet (one L1 object compatible with a jet) seed, after run 275319 in 2016 and in full 2017 it is also seeded by a SingleTau (one L1 object compatible with a $\tau$) seed. The presence of the SingleJet and SingleTau seeds is mean to mitigate the loss of efficiency for high \et electron. The exact unprescaled threshold of each of those seeds changes in time. The lowest threshold for the SingleEG which was always unprescaled was 40 GeV with the corresponding thresholds for the DoubleEG seed being 24 GeV,17 GeV.

The trigger efficiency is computed as a product of 3 terms: the L1 trigger efficiency, the HLT supercluster \et filter efficiency (the HLT turn on curve) and the online electron identification (CaloIdL+MW or GsfTrkIdVL) efficiency. For the final results only \et dependent efficiency is used to weight MC events, other efficiencies are cancelled in the normalisation of MC events to data in the Z peak region ($\mathrm{M_{ee}}$ in 60-120 GeV). The method to measure the efficiencies is  described in Section \ref{sec:trigger_efficiency_method}. The L1 trigger efficiency of primary signal trigger is shown in Section \ref{sec:L1_trigger_efficiency}. The HLT \et turn on curve and HLT identification efficiency of primary signal trigger are presented in Section \ref{sec:HLT_efficiency}. Other trigger efficiencies are given in Section \ref{sec:Other_HLT_efficiency}.

\subsection{Method for Measuring Trigger Efficiencies in Data}\label{sec:trigger_efficiency_method}
The tag and probe method \cite{CMS-AN-2009-111} is used to measure the efficiency of a given selection in data. There are reasons to use tag and probe method. First one is the tag can be asked to match with trigger, by doing this, the probe will not be biased by trigger requirement. Second one is by requiring tight selection on tag, the probe will most likely be real electron not the jet fake electron. The events are selected by HLT\_Ele27\_eta2p1\_WPTight (which requires one HLT electron candidate with supercluster \et higher than 27 GeV and $|\eta|$ less than 2.1 and passing tight online electron cut) for 2016 and HLT\_Ele35\_WPTight (which requires one HLT electron candidate with supercluster \et higher than 35 GeV and passing tight online electron cut) for 2017. The tag is the electron which passes HLT\_Ele27\_eta2p1\_WPTight (HLT\_Ele35\_WPTight) in 2016 (2017) and passes HEEP ID (as defined in Section \ref{sec:Zprime_HEEP}) and is in barrel of ECAL. The probe is the electron which passes the HEEP ID as well as any other requirements necessary to measure the given efficiency such as being matched to the \et filter to measure the trigger identification efficiency.

To simplify the computation, tags can not be probes. In the case of the probe being in the barrel, the tag is required to have a smaller supercluster $\phi$ than the probe for even number events and a larger supercluster $\phi$ for odd number events. As the sample is already very pure given there are two electrons passing HEEP ID, no background subtraction is applied, nor any mass window cut is imposed. When measuring efficiencies involving the unseeded leg of the HLT\_DoubleEle33\_CaloIdL\_MW (or HLT\_DoubleEle33\_CaloIdL\_GsfTrkIdVL) trigger path, the tag should additionally pass the L1 seeded leg of that trigger and be matched to a L1 EG object, using a $\Delta R$ cone of 0.1 to be completely sure that the unseeded leg is unbiased by L1 seeded trigger. The efficiency is equal to the number of passing probes divided by all probes shown in Equation \ref{eq:tag_probe_eff}.
\begin{equation}
\epsilon=\frac{N_{passing~probes}}{N_{all~probes}}
\label{eq:tag_probe_eff}
\end{equation}

The L1 trigger efficiency and HLT turn on curves are fitted with either a single or double turn on function (defined in terms of ``error function'' $erf$). The double turn on function is shown in Equation \ref{eq:turn_on}, with the single turn on function being identical except that the B terms are removed. The A0 and B0 parameters can be interpreted as the efficiency at the plateau, the A1 and B1 as the values where the efficiency reaches half maximum and A2 and B2 are the turn on of the curve.
\begin{equation}
f(\et)=0.5\cdot A0\cdot(1+erf(\frac{\et-A1}{\sqrt{2}\cdot A2}))+0.5\cdot B0\cdot(1+erf(\frac{\et-B1}{\sqrt{2}\cdot B2}))
\label{eq:turn_on}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Primary Signal Trigger: L1 Efficiency}\label{sec:L1_trigger_efficiency}
In 2016 the efficiency for a HEEP electron to pass the lowest unprescaled L1 SingleEG seed is shown in Figure \ref{fig:L1_eff_2016}. From applying to MC events, this translates to an efficiency of 99.5\% to select barrel-barrel events and 98.8\% to select barrel-endcap events in a mass range of 60 to 120 GeV and a $\sim$100\% efficiency above 120 GeV. This is a lower bound on the efficiency, because there is the DoubleEG L1 seed which will further increase the efficiency. So it can be assumed the L1 seed trigger efficiency is 100\% with a 0.5\% uncertainty in the barrel and 1.2\% in the endcap.

\label{fig:L1_eff_2016}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In 2017 the efficiency for a HEEP electron to pass the lowest unprescaled L1 SingleEG seed is shown in Figure \ref{fig:L1_eff_2017}. In both barrel and endcap, a slow threshold related turn on and a slow general increase in efficiency in the plateau due to increasing efficiency of the L1 ID requirements are observed. From applying to MC events, this translates to an efficiency of 71\% to select barrel-barrel events and 67\% to select barrel-endcap events with the worst case where the supercluster \et of both electrons is 35 GeV. The efficiency is higher than 99.5\% for two electrons with supercluster \et more than 42 GeV in barrel and more than 47 GeV in endcap. This is a lower bound on the efficiency, becasue there is the DoubleEG L1 seed which will further increase the efficiency.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

Due to the fact that the L1 efficiency is not 100\% for low \et electrons in 2017, the L1 seeded trigger turn on is considered in the 2017 analysis as described below. In data, we require for at least one of the selected electrons to be matched with the object of L1 seed trigger filter of the HLT\_DoubleEle33\_CaloIdL\_MW and with that object having a L1 \et greater than the lowest unprescaled L1 SingleEG seed \et threshold. Therefore, only L1 SingleEG seed turn on shown in Figure \ref{fig:L1_eff_2017} is used to weight MC events. Since only one electron is seeded by L1 in HLT\_DoubleEle33\_CaloIdL\_MW, the L1 weight value of selected MC events is shown in Equation \ref{eq:L1_turn_on} where $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ are the L1 SingleEG efficiencies (shown in Figure \ref{fig:L1_eff_2017}) for leading and sub-leading selected HEEP electrons.
\begin{equation}
weight(L1)=1-(1-P_{1})\cdot(1-P_{2})=P_{1}+P_{2}-P_{1}P_{2}
\label{eq:L1_turn_on}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Primary Signal Trigger: HLT Efficiency}\label{sec:HLT_efficiency}
The HLT efficiency is divided into two components, the efficiency of the supercluster $\et>33$ GeV cut (the turn on curve) and the efficiency of the CaloIdL plus MW matching (or GsfTrkIdVL) identification requirements. The turn on curves of the \et cut for 2016 and 2017 are shown in Figure \ref{fig:HLT_turnon_2016} and Figure \ref{fig:HLT_turnon_2017}, respectively. These turn on curves are used to weight the MC events.
The efficiency of the CaloIdL plus MW matching (or GsfTrkIdVL) identification requirements for 2016 and 2017 are shown in Figure \ref{fig:HLT_ID_2016} and Figure \ref{fig:HLT_ID_2017}, respectively. As the efficiencies are flat versus \et, there is no need to weight MC events with this factor as it will automatically be included in the Z peak normalisation.

\subsection{Other Trigger Efficiencies}\label{sec:Other_HLT_efficiency}
In 2016 the data-MC HEEP ID efficiency scale factor study uses events selected by the \\
HLT\_Ele27\_eta2p1\_WPTight trigger path. The efficiency of this path in data is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Ele27_2016}. Similar for 2017 the HLT\_Ele35\_WPTight trigger path is used and the efficiency of this trigger is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Ele35_2017}. These curves are used to weight MC events to simulate the effect of the trigger requirement in data.
