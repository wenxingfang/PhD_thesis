\chapter{Search for New Physics via Top Quark Production in Dilepton Final State}\label{chap:tW}
This chapter introduces the search for new physics via top quark production in ee and \mumu final states (the motivation is described in Section \ref{tW_Int}). The data-set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 \fbinv of proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV, and was collected in 2016 by the CMS detector. The search is sensitive to new physics in top quark pair production and in single top quark production in association with a W boson. The data and MC samples are introduced in Section \ref{tW_Samples}. In Section \ref{tW_Trigger} the triggers used are given. The object identification are presented in Section \ref{tW_Objectselection}. The event selection is given in Section \ref{tW_Eventselection}. In Section \ref{tW_background} the SM backgrounds are described. The data and MC comparisons for different variables are presented in Section \ref{tW_data_mc}. The signal extraction is expressed in Section \ref{signal}. The systematic uncertainties are described in Section \ref{tW_systematic}. Finally, the limits for different effective couplings are given in Section \ref{tW_Results}.
