\section{Triggers}
\label{tW_Trigger}

In this analysis we use various sets of triggers in order to achieve an optimal selection efficiency.
For each dilepton channel (ee, \mumu) we take the logical OR of the dilepton triggers listed
in Table \ref{tab:trigger}. The double electron trigger ``HLT\_Ele23\_Ele12\_caloIdL\_TrackIdL\_IsoVL\_DZ'' (which selects two electrons and one of them with \pt $>$ 23 GeV and another with \pt $>$ 12 GeV, besides both electrons pass loose calo ID, loose track ID, very loose isolation cut, and DZ cut which is the z distance between the track and primary vertex) and the single electron trigger ``HLT\_Ele27\_WPTight\_Gsf'' (which selects one electron with \pt $>$ 27 GeV and passing tight working point) are used in ee channel. For \mumu channel, the double muon trigger ``HLT\_Mu17\_TrkIsoVVL\_Mu8\_TrkIsoVVL'' (which selects two global muons (see definition in Section \ref{subsec:Global_muon} and one of them with \pt $>$ 17 GeV and another with \pt $>$ 8 GeV, besides both muons pass very very loose track isolation cut) is used in MC and in data from run B to run G. For data run H the DZ cut is added for this trigger, due to the increase of the instantaneous luminosity delivered by the LHC in run H. A similar trigger ``HLT\_Mu17\_TrkIsoVVL\_TkMu8\_TrkIsoVVL'' (replace ``Mu8'' with ``TkMu8'' which is tracker muon (see definition in Section \ref{subsec:Tracker_muon}) with \pt $>$ 8 GeV) is used. Moreover, the single muon triggers ``HLT\_IsoMu24'' (isolated global muon with \pt $>$ 24 GeV) and ``HLT\_IsoTkMu24'' (isolated tracker muon with \pt $>$ 24 GeV) are also used.


We complement the partially inefficient dilepton triggers by single lepton triggers ( by using \ttbar and tW MC samples, it is found that by adding single lepton triggers, the trigger efficiency is increased by around 5\%.) and remove the overlap between two
primary data sets by vetoing events that fired a dilepton trigger in the single lepton primary data sets.
%Because the e$\upmu$ channel is complemented by two single lepton primary data sets, the
%procedure has two steps: We first add events from the SingleElectron primary data set that
%fired single electron triggers but failed the double lepton triggers that we use to select events
%in the MuonEG primary data set. We furthermore add events from the SingleMuon primary
%data set that fired single muon triggers but fired none of the triggers we use to select events in
%either the MuonEG or the SingleElectron primary data set.

Since the trigger information is available in simulated samples, we require MC samples to fire the trigger and finally apply corrections for any data/MC disagreement using scale factors.
The TOP group recommended trigger scale factors (described in \cite{trSF}) are used.
We also have estimated the trigger scale factors by ourself as a cross check, and it gave similar results (although they are not used in this analysis).
