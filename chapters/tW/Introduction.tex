\section{Introduction}
\label{tW_Int}



In this chapter, a search for new physics in top quark production using an EFT framework is reported. Final states with two same flavor opposite-sign isolated leptons (electrons or muons) in association with jets identified as originated from the fragmentation of a b quark (``b jets'') are analysed.
%The purpose of this paper is to search for new physics in tW and \ttbar production in dilepton final state using EFT framework.
The search is sensitive to new physics contributions to the tW and \ttbar ~production, and the six effective couplings, \CG, \Cphiq, \CtW, \CtG, \CuG, and \CcG, are constrained independently.
Kinematic distributions of final state particles and the production rate of the tW and \ttbar ~processes are both affected by the effective couplings. For the \Cphiq, \CtW, \CtG, and \CG effective couplings, the deviation from the SM prediction is dominated by the interference term between SM and new physics diagrams, which is linear with respect to the effective coupling. Therefore, kinematic distributions of final state particles vary as a function of Wilson coefficients and a small value of the effective couplings leads to distributions similar to the SM predictions.
On the other hand, the new physics terms for the \CuG and \CcG effective couplings do not interfere with the SM tW process, and the kinematic distributions of final state particles are determined by the new physics term independently of the SM prediction.
In this analysis, we use the rates of tW and \ttbar ~production for probing the \Cphiq, \CtW, \CtG, and \CG effective couplings, while both variation in rate and kinematic distributions of final state particles are employed  for probing the \CuG and \CcG effective couplings.





The chapter is structured as follows. In Section \ref{tW_Samples}, a description of the data and simulated samples used in the analysis is detailed. The trigger used in this analysis is detailed in Section \ref{tW_Trigger}. The object selection and event selection are presented in Section \ref{tW_Objectselection} and \ref{tW_Eventselection}, respectively. The SM background estimation and data mc distribution are presented in sections \ref{tW_background} and Section \ref{tW_data_mc}, respectively.
Section \ref{signal} presents a description of the signal extraction procedure.
An overview of the systematic uncertainty treatment is given in Section \ref{tW_systematic}. A cross check for measuring SM tW process cross section is provided in appendix \ref{App_tW_XS}.
Finally, the constraints on the effective couplings are presented in Section \ref{tW_Results}, and a summary is given in Section \ref{sec:tW_summary}.
