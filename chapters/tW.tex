\chapter{Search for new physics via top quark production in dilepton final state}\label{chap:tW}
\textit{This chapter introduced searching for new physics via top quark production in $ee$ and $\mu\mu$ final state. The data-set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 \fbinv\ of proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV, and was collected in 2016 by the CMS detector. The search is sensitive to new physics in top quark pair production and in single top quark production in association with a W boson. This is the first search for new physics that uses the tW process.No significant deviation from the standard model expectation is observed.
Results are interpreted in the framework of an effective field theory and constraints on the relevant effective couplings are set using a dedicated multivariate analysis.}
