\chapter*{Introduction}

Where are we come from? What is the original of the Universe?  What is the most fundamental element in the Universe? These are interesting, basic and important questions. Although they are difficult to be answered, we are on the way to find the answers. 

The particle physics is a subject which trying to find the basic particles in the Universe and to understand the interaction mechanisms between these fundamental particles. The most well known and successful theory in particle physics is the Standard Model (SM) which managed to explain the experimental observations with outstanding precision. Among them, the final missing piece of the SM, the "Higgs" particle which introduced in 1964 by Brout, Englert and Higgs in order to explain the origin of masses of elementary particles, has been found in 2012 (48 years after its prediction) at a mass of around 125 GeV by ATLAS experiment and Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at Large Hadron Collider (LHC). 

The LHC is the largest hadron collider in the world providing proton-proton collisions with the highest center-of-mass energy ever achieved (13 TeV from 2015 to 2018). They are four main experiments at the LHC, one of them is the CMS, which is, as the ATLAS experiment, a general purpose detector. The discovery of "Higgs" by joint efforts of the ATLAS and CMS collaborations is one of the most important achievements of modern particle physics research and accomplished one of the main goals of the LHC program.

Nevertheless, the tremendous successes of the SM, it is still not able to describe the full picture of Nature. Such as it doesn't show candidates of dark matter and dark energy, it doesn't predict the oscillation of neutrinos, it doesn't have good explaination for the asymmetry between matter and antimatter. Besides, it have some issues of internal consistency, such as hierarchy problem, larger number of free parameters and so on. Therefore, the SM is generally considered as an effective theory of a more fundamental theory in low energy. In order to address some shortcomings of SM, several models that go beyond the SM have been proposed. Such as supersymmetric models (SUSY) which provide a candidate of dark matter and provide explaination to the Higgs mass fine-tuning problem, or The Grand Unified Theory (GUT) which try to unify electromagnetic, weak and strong interaction into one interaction through the extensions of the SM gauge group, or The extra dimensions theory which involving additional spatial dimensions to explain the weakness of the gravitational force compared to the other forces. These beyond SM models introduce new neutral bosons heavier than the standard model Z boson, which are generically called Z' bosons. 

If the masses scale of such new particles are reachable in collider experiment, these particles would manifest themselves as a localised excess of events in the observed invariant mass spectra. In this thesis, directly searching for new heavy resonance decay into dielectron final state has been performed. This channel has the advantage that electron reconstruction can be very well understood and very efficient which leads to a low background contamination coming from misreconstructed
electron candidates. Besides, the component of SM background in this channel is well understand and the rate is small in high mass region. These facts give a strong motivation for searching new heavy resonances in dielectron final state.

However, if the new physics scale is not reachable in collider experiment, new physics could affect SM interactions indirectly, through modifications of SM couplings or enhancements of rare SM processes. Due to its large mass, close to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale, the top quark is expected to play an important role in several new physics scenarios. An effective field theory (EFT) approach which is a model-independent approach is used in this thesis to search for new physics in the top quark sector in the ee and $\mu\mu$ final states.



The thesis is organised as follows. The SM of elementary particle physics is introduced in Chapter \ref{sec:SM}, including a description of fundamental particles, the forces between these particles, the main properties of the SM Drell-Yan process and the EFT theory. Chapter \ref{chp:BSM} lists the shortcomings of the SM and address how various theories beyond the SM propose to solve them. In particular, the models that predict additional massive resonances decaying in dielectron final state are introduced. Besides, the motivation of searching new physics in the top quark sector is also given. Chapter \ref{chap:LHC_CMS} gives the introduction of LHC including  its design and operational parameters as well as the phenomenological aspects of the proton-proton interactions. Moveover, the CMS detector and its sub-detectors are also introduced in detail in this chapter. The reconstruction of different objects from the proton proton collision in CMS are described in Chapter \ref{chap:Event_reconstruction}. Chapter \ref{chap:Zprime} describes in detail the results of the search for new resonances decaying in the dielectron final state and all the aspects of the analysis are covered. The results of the search for new physics in the top quark sector are shown in Chapter \ref{chap:tW}, covering as well all the aspects of the analysis. Finally, Chapter  exposes the conclusions coming from both searches.
