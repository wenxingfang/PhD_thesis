\chapter*{Introduction}

%Where are we come from ? Does university has boundary ? What are the basic elements which construct our university ? From time to time these questions will come to my mind and make me lost in the thought, maybe also the same for you.
%What a lucky thing for me is I choosed the particle physics expreiment as my PhD research subject. The aim of particle physics experiment is to find the basic particles which formed the matter world, studying their properties and their interaction mechanism (or put it simply how they make the world).
%
%There are a lot particle physics experiments over the world and can mostly be categorized in three kinds by the way of the studied particles come from.
%First one are the cosmic rays experiments which stduy the particles come from the universe. The advantages of this kind of experiments are easy to make the detector and cheap in the cost, while the disadvantages includes the very low count rate for very high energy particles and can only detect the long lifetime or stable particles like $e^{\pm}$, $\gamma$, $\pi^{\pm}$ and so on. For unstable or short lifetime particles it can do nonthing.
%
%Second one are the nulcear reaction experiments which mostly study the properties of neutrino, because when the fission happens a lot of neutron will be produced and one neutron can decays to one proton, one electron and one anti-neutrino. Therefore the reactor can produce abundant neutrinos which has precise producing time and position and known to be electron anti-neutrion, therefore it can be use for studying the neutrion oscillation phenomenon. The advantage for this kind experiment is the low cost because the stable neutrino beam is the by-products of reactor and it is free. The disadvantage is it can only study the neutrino.
%
%Third one are the collider experiments which make the collision between two accelerated high energy particles and detect the particles from the collision. The collided particles are most the electron, positron, proton and anti-proton because they are stable and easy to be accelerated. The advantages of this kind of experiment are high luminosity (means high statistic), the collision energy can be control and a lot of particles can be studyed including very short lifetime particles. For the disadvantages it includes high cost which comes from building the long accelerated tunnel and to accelerate particles and making a complicated detector which used to reconstruct the whole collision event.

%What I joined is CMS experiment in LHC which is the proton proton collision experiment
